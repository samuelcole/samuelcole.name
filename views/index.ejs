    <h2>2008 – 2010</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://patch.com/">patch.com</a>:
      in the summer of '08, i moved to new york city, and started my first job as
      the original front-end engineer at a startup that was building a yet-unnamed
      network of local news sites. we ended up calling it patch, and later selling
      it to aol.

    <h2>2010 – 2014</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">kickstarter.com</a>:
      a few of my friends started working on a new website that would let artists
      raise money from their friends/family/fans to fund their creative projects.
      as a creator myself, i was thrilled to empower that mission, so i joined
      them as the twelfth employee and third engineer.

    <h2>2014 – 2015</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.jukely.com/">jukely.com</a>:
      once kickstarter was established, i was looking for new ways to empower
      artists, and one of my friends had started a company designed to bring
      people out to live music events, with a particular focus on discovering
      bands at their beginning of their careers. it began as an iphone app, so
      they brought me on as lead web engineer, to build their website.

    <h2>2015 – 2017</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.abacus.com/">abacus.com</a>:
      from my experience at kickstarter, i knew that once creative projects
      got to a certain point and spun into their own companies, they needed
      a whole suite of supporting software. i was thrilled to help build
      financial products for young companies. we were ultimately acquired by
      emburse.

    <h2>2017 –</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/">actblue.com</a>:
      during the 2016 election, i got involved with all-virtual volunteer
      groups of technical folks that were building technology to help
      progressive campaigns win elections. in 2017 i started looking for
      a way to do that work full time, and i found actblue, a non-profit
      tech company that builds a fundraising platform for progressives,
      which perfectly fit with both my background and my ideals.
